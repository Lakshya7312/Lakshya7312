Hey there! I'm Lakshya, a 16-year-old developer with a passion for creating awesome things using React Native, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm always learning and expanding my skillset, and currently, I'm also diving into Java and Python!

I'm eager to collaborate with others on projects that involve the languages I'm proficient in. If you're interested in working together, feel free to reach out via email! Let's create something amazing together.
